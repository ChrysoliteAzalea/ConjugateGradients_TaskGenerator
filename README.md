This is a program that generates a task file for conjugate gradients program. It can be compiled with any C++ compiler.

It takes two arguments -- the amount of the equations, and the acceptable error, and prints the contents of the new task file to the standard input. The generated task contains a random system of linear equations that can be solved with conjugate gradiens method.

This is not a parallel program.
